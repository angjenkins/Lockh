							The Express Desk processes vehicle orders for government agencies
							with urgent requirements. Agencies must justify the urgent and
							compelling reasons for using the Express Desk instead of waiting
							for the normal procurement cycle and delivery time to take place.
							<br> <br> Prices will generally be higher than the
							established contract prices because the vehicles are purchased
							from a dealership and not directly from the manufacturer. Rules
							and guidelines governing the Express Desk:<br> <br> •
							GSA is the mandatory source for non-tactical vehicles.<br> •
							GSA by regulation MUST seek three sources of competition for the
							procurement.<br> • GSA encourages customers to recommend the
							names of dealers within the delivery area to be solicited by GSA.
							Please advise GSA of the names, addresses, phone numbers and
							dealer contacts with the requisition. There is no guarantee that
							a suggested source will receive a contract award. <br> •
							Customers should NOT negotiate terms and conditions with a
							potential contractor prior to sending in a requisition to GSA. <br>
							• After being advised by GSA about the price and any exceptions
							or clarifications covering the vehicle(s) solicited, agencies
							must expedite final decisions. Dealers will generally not hold
							vehicle(s) more than 48 hours. <br> • The government's
							payment terms are always NET 30 days upon receipt of a proper
							invoice. <br> • The GSA surcharge for Express Desk orders is
							one percent, except during August through September, when the
							surcharge is five percent. <br> <br>
